# Before You Read

Please leave a star if you like my solution 😊

I am starting my solving-Leetcode-problem journey since May 2019 by Visual studio 2019 and C#. Besides source code which solving specific problems, there are test cases in another solution which contains all the cases from examples, Leetcode Online Judge, or myself.

These might not the best solutions in the world, but I am trying to slove these problems clean and easy. In fact, if you want to get a best solution, you know you can get a sample from the distribution chart. That might be the place you are looking for.

I highly recomment leetcode users keeping all the trail during your problem solving, no mattter it is a easy problem or a difficult one. There are two reasons: first, you can keep a note about your current thinking and methodology; there are no good idea or bad idea when you are practicing, however, sometimes 'why' is more important that 'how'. the second one is the habit: please try to get used to push your code every small piece of work, it will save you (literately) in the future.

You can keep it in you github, in your blog, in your diary, in a Trello, or anywhere you are comfortable (in my opinion, instead of mark source code or leave comments behind or after your source code, make your source code readable will be more efficiency).

Meanwhile, please form a good habit when you are coding. For example, naming, trying not to use some meanless variable name such as 'a', 'b' 'str', even 'i' in a for while. Trying not to be affected by leetcode. You can get a copy of coding convention from your familiar language on the internet and follow the rules. For example,

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions

Another good habit is testing. The testing will help you to consider the corner conditions (No kidding!)

Finally, enjoy your leetcode journey!
