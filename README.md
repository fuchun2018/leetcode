# Before You Read

Please leave a star if you like my solution 😊

I am starting my solving-Leetcode-problem journey since May 2019 by Visual studio 2019 and C#. Besides source code which solving specific problems, there are test cases in another solution which contains all the cases from examples, Leetcode Online Judge, or myself.

These might not the best solutions in the world, but I am trying to slove these problems clean and easy. In fact, if you want to get a best solution. You know you can get a sample from the distribution chart. That might be the place you are looking for.

I highly recommand leetcode users keep all the trail when you are trying to solve a problem, either it is a easy problem or a difficult one. You can keep it in you github, in your blog, in your diary, in a Trello, or anywhere you are comfortable (in my opinion, instead of mark source code or leave comments behind or after your source code, make your source code readable will be more efficiency).

Meanwhile, form a good habit on coding. For example, naming, trying not to use some meanless variable name such as 'a', 'b' 'str'. trying not to be affected by leetcode. Get a copy of coding convention from your familiar language and follow the rules.

Another good habit is testing. The testing will help you to consider the corner conditions (No kidding!)

Finally, enjoy your leetcode journey!
